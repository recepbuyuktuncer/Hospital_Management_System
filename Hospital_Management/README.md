# Hospital Automation System (C Project)

This is a simple hospital automation system written in C. It includes features such as:

- Patient registration
- Doctor login and registration
- Examination result recording
- Displaying waiting patients
- Listing all doctors

This project was created to strengthen my C programming skills by working with file handling, structs, and basic control flow in a real-world-like scenario.

## How to Run

Compile with:
```bash
gcc project_1.c -o hospital_automation
